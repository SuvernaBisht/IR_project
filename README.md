# Depression Detection using twitter data

Depression is major cause of many disease and there are majority of people(70%) who do not visit doctor for depression. Rather they rely on social sites to pour there emotions. Using computational approaches to understand mental health status (MHS) allows us to discover and identify risky behaviors, at an early stage and can be used to provide treatment and intervention, to a population that is generally hard to reach. So we try to come up with a model that can help us predict depression using social media of a person and have proper intervention at an early stage.

## Models Used
* LSTM
* LSTM with Attention

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from the [1]. We are using a subset of this dataset. It consists of social media details about the users such as social network features, profile details, visual features, emotion features, topic level features, domain and user specific features. The dataset has been divided into negative and positive data on the basis of whether the user was found to be positive or negative for depression. We extract and combine all the tweets posted by the users and then divide the tweets in sets of 20.

## Getting Started

These instructions will enable the user to access the code easily for development and testing purposes.
